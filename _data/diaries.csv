Harry S. Truman,1947,1,6,"Arose at 5:45 A.M.[,] read the papers and at 7:10 walked to the station to meet the family. Took 35 minutes. It was a good walk. Sure is fine to have them back. This great white jail is a hell of a place in which to be alone. While I work from early morning until late at night, it is a ghostly place. The floors pop and crack all night long. Anyone with imagination can see old Jim Buchanan walking up and down worrying about conditions not of his making. Then there's Van Buren who inherited a terrible mess from his predecessor as did poor old James Madison. Of course Andrew Johnson was the worst mistreated of any of them. But they all walk up and down the halls of this place and moan about what they should have done and didn't. So-you see. I've only named a few. The ones who had Boswells and New England historians are too busy trying to control heaven and hell to come back here. So the tortured souls who were and are misrepresented in history are the ones who come back. It's a hell of a place.
Read my annual message. It was good if I do say it myself. Outlines by me to begin with, the cabinet, the little cabinet, Sam Rosenman, the Chief Justice all added criticisms. Clark Clifford did most of the work. He's a nice boy and will go places.",https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page5.htm,https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html,5846968,,,,,,,
Harry S. Truman,1947,1,7,"A terrific day. After the usual go around, discussion of the budget and other things, a swim seemed to be in order.
Mr. Byrnes called at 5 P.M. and said he'd like to see me. He came to the executive office and told me that there had been a leak on his resignation, effective Jan. 10th. I had expected to hold a press conference at 4:00 P.M. Jan. 10th and announce the resignation of Mr[.] Byrnes as Sec[retary] of State. About 5 P.M. Mr. B[yrnes] called me and asked if he could see me. I was getting ready for a swim but of course I see any Cabinet Officer at any time. He came to the exec[utive] office all out of breath and told me that the N. Y. Times had obtained the information of his resignation and that he was morally certain that the information had leaked at the White House. Well only my Secretarial Staff knew of it-and they had known since April 19, 1946! Mr. Byrnes finally got round to suggesting that the release should be made at once. Well I called in Charlie Ross and Bill Hassett and we cooked up the release and it was made.
I had indicated to Gen[eral] Marshall that the release would not be made until Jan[.] 10th. But Gen[eral] Marshall is a real man and I'm sure he'll understand just as I do. Byrnes was very happy at the Diplomatic Reception at 9 P.M. although he was late.",https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page6.htm,https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html,5847522,,,,,,,
Harry S. Truman,1947,1,8,"The papers this morning are full of Marshall's appointment and Mr. B[yrne]'s resignation. I am very sorry Mr. Byrnes decided to quit. I'm sure he'll regret it-and I know I do. He is a good negotiator-a very good one. But of course I don't want to be the cause of his death and his Dr. told him in March 1946 that he must slow down. So much for that.
The Senate took Marshall lock, stock and barrell [sic]. Confirmed him by unanimous consent and did not even refer his nomination to a committee. A grand start for him.
I am very happy over that proceedure [sic]. Marshall is, I think[,] the greatest man of the World War II. He managed to get along with Roosevelt, the Congress, Churchill, the Navy and the Joint Chief of Staff and he made a grand record in China.
When I asked him to take the extrovert Pat Hurley[']s place as my special envoy to China, he merely said ""Yes, Mr. President I'll go."" No argument only patriotic action. And if any man was entitled to balk and ask for a rest, he was.

After complimenting the show and entertainment and thanking the Club for a pleasant evening, I explained that organizations and individuals were constantly importuning me to make proclamations for various days & weeks, such as Cat Week, Horse Week, Foot Happiness Week, Laugh Week, Liars Week[,] etc. Each one was discussed and elaborated to some extent and the audience seemed pleased.

Harry S. Truman,1947,1,16,"Had quite a day. (Look at schedule for this day, the day before and the day before that.) The Crown Prince of Arabia with his retinue and the Minister from his country to ours came in with the Secretary of State (Mr. Byrnes) and discussed Mid East Affairs at some length. Arabians are jealous of Syrians, Iraqis, Egyptians and Turks. They seem to like us but are suspicious of the British. They hate the Bolshiviks [sic]. It was an interesting talk.
They afterwards came to lunch. It was a gala affair. See guest list.
Was sitting at my desk just before dinner tonight when [name of person and staff position restricted] came up and asked if he might speak to me. He was scared stiff and almost crying. Said he'd got his checks mixed up, had lied to the Secret Service and he wanted to tell me before his boss did. As usual I felt sorry for him and promised to help him out. I wonder why nearly everyone makes a father confessor out of me. I must look benevolent or else I'm a known easy mark. Well any way I like people and like to help 'em and keep 'em out of trouble when I can and help 'em out when they get into it.
The rule around here is that no one may speak to the President. I break it every day and make 'em speak to me. So-you see what I get. But I still want 'em to tell me.",https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page9.htm,https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html,5848069,,,,,,,

Harry S. Truman,1947,3,4,"Come into sight of Monterey [sic] after the sun had been up an hour or two. Country looks like a map. About nine or nine thirty see Popocatepetl and try to see Orizaba-haze too thick[,] can't see it. Approach rim around Tenochtitlan Valley-up 11000 feet. No discomfort. Beautiful valley. Must have been lovely when a lake. Too bad the Spaniards drained it. Made a lot of dust.
Perfect day. Land at 10:00 on the dot. My pilot never misses a schedule.
Step down from plane. Mexican President comes down steps of observation tower at same time. We meet. I like him at once. He introduces his Cabinet, I introduce my secretaries and aides.
We walk to platform beautiful [sic] decorated with flowers-both flags worked out in flowers. The Mexican President welcomes me. I am made a citizen of the Federal district by its Governor-another Aleman[,] no kin of the President. He pins a beautiful gold medal on me. I make suitable reply and mispronounce Tenochtitlan to the delight of everybody.
We get into my big open Lincoln car and start for American Embassy.
Never saw such crowds-such enthusiasm. Arrive at Embassy[,] bid President goodbye. Have dinner at Palace where I make a speech in reply to the [Truman writes ""Tuesday night"" above this part of the entry] Mexican Presidents. Shake hands with some two or three thousand. The President & I go out upon a balcony with a rug over the railing and wave to a sea of people-thousands so they say. Have seen pictures of Franz Joseph, Marcus Aurelius & Napoleon doing it. But it[']s my first time.
Tuesday morning lay a wreath on soldiers monument with lots and lots of ceremony. Then the Foreign Minister and I drive to the Chepultepec where I place a wreath on the Monument to the Ninos [sic] Heros [sic]-cadets who stood up to Old Fuss & Feathers until all but one was killed. He wraped [sic] the Mexican Flag around himself and jumped 200 feet to his death. The monument is where he fell. Had all the cadets lined up and the Foreign Minister and the Commandant of the Cadets wept-so did news men and photographers. I almost did myself. It seems that tribute to these young heros [sic] really set off the visit. They had it coming.

Gen[eral] Marshall agreed that they should be tested but at a date beyond the Foreign Minister's meeting in Nov.-say from Feb[.] to April.
I appointed Patterson, Forestal [sic] and Dr. Lillienthal to work out details with Gen[eral] Eisenhower and Adm[iral] Nimitz as advisors. Gen[eral] Marshall & Adm[iral] Leahy to be consulted as developments proceed.

Lunched with Marshall & Att[orne]y. Gen[eral] Clark in John Pye's dining room. Ross, Clifford, Latta[,] Haskett & John Steelman present.
Marshall told the best story of World War II[,] at least Winston Churchill thinks it is. I endorse Churchill's judgement-about an American Army Chaplain being driven into Tunis after the German surrender. All Americans had gone forward so Germans took over traffic direction. Traffic terribly snarled up. The Chaplain with his corporal driver was stopped by a tough Nazi at a street crossing and completely ""balled out"" just as an American cop would do it-only in addition to the balling out the Nazi traffic cop told the chaplain what he thought of the inefficiency and general no account make up of Americans. The Chaplain was kind and polite and tried his level best to be decent. In fact he went so far that the poor corporal driver could hardly hold his tongue. Finally the Chaplain pointed to his insignia and informed the tough Nazi cop that he belonged to the religious section of the army and finally remarked-""I am only up here to plant some of you Nazi bastards."" The corporal was made very happy by that remark and I suppose the good Chaplain regreted [sic] it. Any way it's a good story and I agree with Winston.

Informed him that there were still Nazi war criminals loose in his country. They should be rounded up and deported for trial.
He talked of Communism in Chili [sic], Brazil and Bolivia. It was intimated that Argentines [sic] compliance was the subject of conversation. He said that Communism is rife in Brazil.

Matt & Clark were afraid Luckman is trying to steal the lime light in the food emergency. I'm not. We worked out a statement for the 10 A.M. meeting in the movie room for the Citizens Committee.
It was a good meeting. I went back to the office and had the usual go around until 1 P.M. Then had to decide the argument between Charlie & John and Clark & Matt. I let Luckman announce his committee plan at a press conference, supporting Charlie & John.
Listened to some commentators and then called Dr. Steelman & told him to tell Luckman he'd done well. He'd had a hell of a press conference and some of the smart alecks had tried to trap him.
He came out very well.

Harry S. Truman,1947,7,23,"Had the usual hectic day, though not so bad as some I've had.
Lectured eleven junior Democratic Congressmen on foreign policy. Had four Republicans not long ago-nice young men, to whom I gave the same treatment. If I could only get all the young ones together, the military & foreign policy would become the law of the land.
Talked to young Franklin for almost thirty minutes on Jews, New York, California, his daddy's papers and political matters generally. Said he & his mamma were not with Henry Wallace!
Went to Jim Forestal's [sic] house to a party for Bob Patterson. It was a nice one. A couple of Senators-Vandenburg [sic] & Gurney, the Cabinet, Gen[eral] Eisenhower & three Navy Captains. Don't know [why] Leahy, Nimitz & House members were not there. Sam Rayburn was present-only House member there.
How we'll miss Mrs. Patterson! as well as the Sec[retary] of War. Looks as if we've lost a grand, honest man & wife of the same caliber and have gained a good man and a baby talking, henna haired lady. She went to school with Claire Booth Luce-too bad I'd say. Cabinet women are a problem. I'll write a book on it some day.

6:00 P. M. Monday July 21, 1947

Had ten minutes conversation with Henry Morgenthau about Jewish ship in Palistine [sic]. Told him I would talk to Gen[eral] Marshall about it.
He'd no business, whatever to call me. The Jews have no sense of proportion nor do they have any judgement on world affairs.
Henry brought a thousand Jews to New York on a supposedly temporary basis and they stayed. When the country went backward-and Republican in the election of 1946, this incident loomed large on the D[isplaced] P[ersons] program.
The Jews, I find are very, very selfish. They care not how many Estonians, Latvians, Finns, Poles, Yugoslavs or Greeks get murdered or mistreated as D[isplaced] P[ersons] as long as the Jews get special treatment. Yet when they have power, physical, financial or political neither Hitler nor Stalin has anything on them for cruelty or mistreatment to the under dog. Put an underdog on top and it makes no difference whether his name is Russian, Jewish, Negro, Management, Labor, Mormon, Baptist he goes haywire. I've found very, very few who remember their past condition when prosperity comes.
Look at the Congress[ional] attitude on D[isplaced] P[ersons]-and they all come from D[isplaced] P[erson]s.",https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page21.htm,https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html,5859986,,,,,,,

Harry S. Truman,1947,7,25,"At 3:30 today had a very interesting conversation with Gen[eral] Eisenhower. Sent for him to discuss the new Sec[retary] for National Defense. Asked him if he could work with Forestal [sic]. He said he could. Told him that I would have given the job to Bob Patterson had he stayed on as Sec[retary] of War. I couldn't bring myself to force him to stay. He has three daughters comming [sic] on for education and I know what that means, having had only one. But she is in a class by herself and I shouldn't judge Patterson's three by her. No one ever had a daughter equal to mine!
After the discussion on Forestal [sic] was over Ike & I visited and talked politics. He is going to Columbia U[niversity] in NY as President. What a job he can do there. He'll do it too. We discussed MacArthur and his superiority complex.
When Ike went to the far east on an inspection tour in 1946 I asked him to tell Gen[eral] Marshall, then special envoy to China, if he'd accept appointment to Sec[retary] of State. Byrnes was tired, sick and wanted to quit. Ike, when he returned came in and said ""Gen[eral] Marshall said yes."" So when Byrnes quit I appointed Marshall and did not even ask him about it!
Ike & I think MacArthur expects to make a Roman Triumphal return to the U. S. a short time before the Republican Convention meets in Philadelphia. I told Ike that if he did that that he (Ike) should announce for the nomination for President on the Democratic ticket and that I'd be glad to be in second place, or Vice President. I like the Senate anyway. Ike & I could be elected and my family & myself would be happy outside this great white jail, known as the White House.

Saw Cordell Hull and Adm[iral] King. Both in fine spirits.
Went through 3 or 4 wards and shook hands with patients who couldn't get out of bed. One negro [sic] patient told me that he had some sort of complicated ailment but after shaking my hand he had high blood pressure!
Went over to Walter Reed from Bethesda and went through the bed fast wards with Dr. Graham, my doctor & the C[ommanding] O[fficer] of the hospital. Met forty or fifty patients most of whom were war wounded. They were happy and optimistic. Makes a person ashamed to be gloomy even if world affairs are mixed up.

Harry S. Truman,1949,8,31,"Some day-Walter George, Scott Lucas and Dean Atcheson [sic] came in to discuss trade treaties. Sen. George made me a proposition to extend the present law to Feb. 1950. I told him I would agree to an extention to Feb. 28, 1951 and would be most happy to have him and his Republican opposite member Senator Milikan [sic] of Colo. make the Reciprocal Trade Agreements a campaign issue in 1950. The great Georgia Senator, representative of the National Chamber of Commerce, the Coca Cola Company etc. didn't want that. So we'll start the filibuster when the Senate reconvenes.

At four o'clock Clinton Anderson, Senator from New Mexico, Elmer Thomas, Senator from Oklahoma, Scott Lucas, Illinois floor leader of the majority in the Senate, Charlie Brannan, the Secretary of Agriculture, Harold D.

bill. The Sec of Agriculture, at my direction prepared a farm plan - a good one which I have supported. Stephen Pace produced a committee supported bill in the House which came up and was defeated by a substitute offered by Gore of Tennesee.

My former Secretary of Agriculture, Senator Anderson of New Mexico, who made a wrong guess in 1948 and thought the election of a Senator from N. Mex. surer than the election of the President in 1948, is as Senators always are very jealous of his Cabinet successor. Especially since the press (most often against us) has named the Administration Farm Bill the Brannan Bill. Old man Thomas is a most peculiar person. I've heard him talk for hours on silver. Lead & zinc are Okla. metals. But he's Chairman of the Senate Com. on Agriculture.

I placed the two House members beside me on the President's side of the Cabinet table and put Brannan in the V.P.'s seat across the table with the high powered senators on each side of him. Then we put the ""cards on the table."" I reminded them of the Dem. Platform of 1948 of my 31700 trip and my farm speeches and then the House members came in and did the same. The Senators made speeches and then went back and reported a bill. Will get our farm progress.",,,7542743,,,,,,,

Talked to Bess & Margie in St Louis. The concert was a wow - ""hangin' from the rafters"" says Margie. She says the terrible Post Dispatch (which hates me) and the old dyed in the wool conservative Globe Democrat have been kind to her. Just read an old editorial from the Globe Democrat today which came from Roosevelt's files of 1940. They'd decided that Missouri had gone to hell because I'd beaten the double crosser Lloyd Stark for the nomination for the Senate! Stark had sent the piece to Roosevelt. It's hell how fate works. Stark wanted to be President - I didn't. Stark's buried politically because he is intellectually dishonest.

Arrived at the White House about 9 A.M. Had a beautiful snow the night before. Trees in the White House yard were beautiful. R[ea]r Adm[iral] Foskett came to the House with me and then went home.
Spent the day working on messages. Called all the members of the Cabinet[,] wished them a happy New Year. Called Henry Stimson, Miss Perkins, Gen[eral] Eisenhower and Gen[eral] Flemming too.",http://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page2.htm,http://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/,5842409,,,,,JPG,Y,
Harry S. Truman,1947,1,3,"Byrnes & I discussed General Marshall's last letter and decided to ask him to come home. Byrnes is going to quit on the tenth and I shall make Marshall Sec[retary] of State. Some of the crackpots will in all probability yell their heads off-but let 'em yell! Marshall is the ablest man in the whole gallery.

Mrs. Roosevelt came in at 3 P.M. to assure me that Jimmy & Elliott had nothing against me and intended no disparagement of me in their recent non-edited remarks. Said she was for me. Said she didn't like Byrnes and was sure he was not reporting Elliott correctly. Said Byrnes was always for Byrnes and no one else. I wonder! He's been loyal to me[.] In the Senate he gave me my first small appropriation, which started the Special Committee to investigate the National Defense Program on its way. He'd probably have done me a favor if he'd refused to give it.

Maybe there was something on both sides in this situation. It is a pity a great man has to have progeny! Look at Churchill's. Remember Lincoln's and Grant's. Even in collateral branches Washington's wasn't so good-and Teddy Roosevelt's are terrible.",http://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page3.htm,http://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/,5842783,,,,,JPG,Y,
