No calendar has been located for the years 1919 and 1920. In general, the calendar entries include the name of the visitor and perhaps the name of an organization. The calendar entries generally do not include chance or unscheduled meetings with Mr. Hoover or the names of all of the members of groups that met with Hoover.\r\n\r\nThe appointment calendar was transcribed by Mildred Mather and converted to a database by Patrick Wildenberg, both archivists at the Hoover Library."}]
