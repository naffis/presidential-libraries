Took 35 minutes. It was a good walk. Sure is fine to have them back. This great white jail is a hell of a place in which to be alone. While I work from early morning until late at night, it is a ghostly place. The floors pop and crack all night long. Anyone with imagination can see old Jim Buchanan walking up and down worrying about conditions not of his making. Then there's Van Buren who inherited a terrible mess from his predecessor as did poor old James Madison. Of course Andrew Johnson was the worst mistreated of any of them. But they all walk up and down the halls of this place and moan about what they should have done and didn't. So-you see. I've only named a few. The ones who had Boswells and New England historians are too busy trying to control heaven and hell to come back here. So the tortured souls who were and are misrepresented in history are the ones who come back. It's a hell of a place.\r\nRead my annual message. It was good if I do say it myself. Outlines by me to begin with, the cabinet, the little cabinet, Sam Rosenman, the Chief Justice all added criticisms. Clark Clifford did most of the work. He's a nice boy and will go places."},{"Meeting Text":"A terrific day. After the usual go around, discussion of the budget and other things, a swim seemed to be in order.\r\nMr. Byrnes called at 5 P.M. and said he'd like to see me. He came to the executive office and told me that there had been a leak on his resignation, effective Jan. 10th. I had expected to hold a press conference at 4:00 P.M. Jan. 10th and announce the resignation of Mr[.] Byrnes as Sec[retary] of State. About 5 P.M. Mr. B[yrnes] called me and asked if he could see me. I was getting ready for a swim but of course I see any Cabinet Officer at any time. He came to the exec[utive] office all out of breath and told me that the N. Y. Times had obtained the information of his resignation and that he was morally certain that the information had leaked at the White House. Well only my Secretarial Staff knew of it-and they had known since April 19, 1946! Mr. Byrnes finally got round to suggesting that the release should be made at once. Well I called in Charlie Ross and Bill Hassett and we cooked up the release and it was made.\r\nI had indicated to Gen[eral] Marshall that the release would not be made until Jan[.] 10th. But Gen[eral] Marshall is a real man and I'm sure he'll understand just as I do. Byrnes was very happy at the Diplomatic Reception at 9 P.M. although he was late."},{"Meeting Text":"The papers this morning are full of Marshall's appointment and Mr. B[yrne]'s resignation. I am very sorry Mr. Byrnes decided to quit. I'm sure he'll regret it-and I know I do. He is a good negotiator-a very good one. But of course I don't want to be the cause of his death and his Dr. told him in March 1946 that he must slow down. So much for that.\r\nThe Senate took Marshall lock, stock and barrell [sic]. Confirmed him by unanimous consent and did not even refer his nomination to a committee. A grand start for him.\r\nI am very happy over that proceedure [sic]. Marshall is, I think[,] the greatest man of the World War II. He managed to get along with Roosevelt, the Congress, Churchill, the Navy and the Joint Chief of Staff and he made a grand record in China.\r\nWhen I asked him to take the extrovert Pat Hurley[']s place as my special envoy to China, he merely said \"Yes, Mr. President I'll go.\" No argument only patriotic action. And if any man was entitled to balk and ask for a rest, he was. We'll have a real State Dep[artmen]t now."},{"Meeting Text":"Went to Nat[ional] Press Club dinner at the Statler. The show was good. I was introduced at the end for remarks. They seemed to be well pleased with what was said. After complimenting the show and entertainment and thanking the Club for a pleasant evening, I explained that organizations and individuals were constantly importuning me to make proclamations for various days & weeks, such as Cat Week, Horse Week, Foot Happiness Week, Laugh Week, Liars Week[,] etc. Each one was discussed and elaborated to some extent and the audience seemed pleased. I hope that was so."},{"Meeting Text":"Had quite a day. (Look at schedule for this day, the day before and the day before that.) The Crown Prince of Arabia with his retinue and the Minister from his country to ours came in with the Secretary of State (Mr. Byrnes) and discussed Mid East Affairs at some length. Arabians are jealous of Syrians, Iraqis, Egyptians and Turks. They seem to like us but are suspicious of the British. They hate the Bolshiviks [sic]. It was an interesting talk.\r\nThey afterwards came to lunch. It was a gala affair. See guest list.\r\nWas sitting at my desk just before dinner tonight when [name of person and staff position restricted] came up and asked if he might speak to me. He was scared stiff and almost crying. Said he'd got his checks mixed up, had lied to the Secret Service and he wanted to tell me before his boss did. As usual I felt sorry for him and promised to help him out. I wonder why nearly everyone makes a father confessor out of me. I must look benevolent or else I'm a known easy mark. Well any way I like people and like to help 'em and keep 'em out of trouble when I can and help 'em out when they get into it.\r\nThe rule around here is that no one may speak to the President. I break it every day and make 'em speak to me. So-you see what I get.

Arrive at Embassy[,] bid President goodbye. Have dinner at Palace where I make a speech in reply to the [Truman writes \"Tuesday night\" above this part of the entry] Mexican Presidents. Shake hands with some two or three thousand. The President & I go out upon a balcony with a rug over the railing and wave to a sea of people-thousands so they say. Have seen pictures of Franz Joseph, Marcus Aurelius & Napoleon doing it. But it[']s my first time.\r\nTuesday morning lay a wreath on soldiers monument with lots and lots of ceremony. Then the Foreign Minister and I drive to the Chepultepec where I place a wreath on the Monument to the Ninos [sic] Heros [sic]-cadets who stood up to Old Fuss & Feathers until all but one was killed. He wraped [sic] the Mexican Flag around himself and jumped 200 feet to his death. The monument is where he fell. Had all the cadets lined up and the Foreign Minister and the Commandant of the Cadets wept-so did news men and photographers. I almost did myself.

I endorse Churchill's judgement-about an American Army Chaplain being driven into Tunis after the German surrender. All Americans had gone forward so Germans took over traffic direction. Traffic terribly snarled up. The Chaplain with his corporal driver was stopped by a tough Nazi at a street crossing and completely \"balled out\" just as an American cop would do it-only in addition to the balling out the Nazi traffic cop told the chaplain what he thought of the inefficiency and general no account make up of Americans. The Chaplain was kind and polite and tried his level best to be decent. In fact he went so far that the poor corporal driver could hardly hold his tongue. Finally the Chaplain pointed to his insignia and informed the tough Nazi cop that he belonged to the religious section of the army and finally remarked-\"I am only up here to plant some of you Nazi bastards.\" The corporal was made very happy by that remark and I suppose the good Chaplain regreted [sic] it.

The Jews have no sense of proportion nor do they have any judgement on world affairs.\r\nHenry brought a thousand Jews to New York on a supposedly temporary basis and they stayed. When the country went backward-and Republican in the election of 1946, this incident loomed large on the D[isplaced] P[ersons] program.\r\nThe Jews, I find are very, very selfish. They care not how many Estonians, Latvians, Finns, Poles, Yugoslavs or Greeks get murdered or mistreated as D[isplaced] P[ersons] as long as the Jews get special treatment. Yet when they have power, physical, financial or political neither Hitler nor Stalin has anything on them for cruelty or mistreatment to the under dog.

What a job he can do there. He'll do it too. We discussed MacArthur and his superiority complex.\r\nWhen Ike went to the far east on an inspection tour in 1946 I asked him to tell Gen[eral] Marshall, then special envoy to China, if he'd accept appointment to Sec[retary] of State. Byrnes was tired, sick and wanted to quit. Ike, when he returned came in and said \"Gen[eral] Marshall said yes.\" So when Byrnes quit I appointed Marshall and did not even ask him about it!\r\nIke & I think MacArthur expects to make a Roman Triumphal return to the U.

I told Ike that if he did that that he (Ike) should announce for the nomination for President on the Democratic ticket and that I'd be glad to be in second place, or Vice President.
