S. Truman","Year":"1947","Month":"7","Day":"28","Meeting Text":"This was a terrible day. Arose at 6:15[,] had breakfast, fixed up by Bess at seven. Didn't sleep much Saturday night or Sunday night. So took a nap after breakfast. Had a time doing it. The Mayor of Ind[e]p[endence,] Roger Sermon, a [World] War I buddy of mine[,] came in at 9:30 with Renick Jones[,] a lifetime friend of mine[,] to pay respects. When they left the house I started to take a nap and Charlie Ross my Press Secretary called and said that the Mexican Ambassador wanted to come and see me on orders from Pres[ident] Aleman to pay his respects personally. He came at 10:30.\r\nI took a short nap, had lunch at 12:00 and went to Grandview, arriving at 1:00. All the cousins on both sides came. About fifty of them. The Baptist preacher Wellborn Bowman conducted the service. It was as mamma wanted it. We went to Forest Hill and the preacher did it excellently at the grave.\r\nAlong the road all cars, trucks and pedestrians stood with hats off. It made me want to weep-but I couldn't in public.\r\nI've read thousands of messages from all over the world in the White House study and I can shed tears as I please-no one's looking.","URL":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page25.htm","Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5859991","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null}]
