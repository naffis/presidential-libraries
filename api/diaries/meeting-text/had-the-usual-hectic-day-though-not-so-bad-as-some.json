If I could only get all the young ones together, the military & foreign policy would become the law of the land.\r\nTalked to young Franklin for almost thirty minutes on Jews, New York, California, his daddy's papers and political matters generally. Said he & his mamma were not with Henry Wallace!\r\nWent to Jim Forestal's [sic] house to a party for Bob Patterson. It was a nice one. A couple of Senators-Vandenburg [sic] & Gurney, the Cabinet, Gen[eral] Eisenhower & three Navy Captains. Don't know [why] Leahy, Nimitz & House members were not there. Sam Rayburn was present-only House member there.\r\nHow we'll miss Mrs. Patterson! as well as the Sec[retary] of War. Looks as if we've lost a grand, honest man & wife of the same caliber and have gained a good man and a baby talking, henna haired lady. She went to school with Claire Booth Luce-too bad I'd say.
