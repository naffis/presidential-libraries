S. Truman","Year":"1947","Month":"1","Day":"8","Meeting Text":"The papers this morning are full of Marshall's appointment and Mr. B[yrne]'s resignation. I am very sorry Mr. Byrnes decided to quit. I'm sure he'll regret it-and I know I do. He is a good negotiator-a very good one. But of course I don't want to be the cause of his death and his Dr. told him in March 1946 that he must slow down. So much for that.\r\nThe Senate took Marshall lock, stock and barrell [sic]. Confirmed him by unanimous consent and did not even refer his nomination to a committee. A grand start for him.\r\nI am very happy over that proceedure [sic]. Marshall is, I think[,] the greatest man of the World War II. He managed to get along with Roosevelt, the Congress, Churchill, the Navy and the Joint Chief of Staff and he made a grand record in China.\r\nWhen I asked him to take the extrovert Pat Hurley[']s place as my special envoy to China, he merely said \"Yes, Mr. President I'll go.\" No argument only patriotic action. And if any man was entitled to balk and ask for a rest, he was. We'll have a real State Dep[artmen]t now.","URL":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page7.htm","Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5847746","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null}]
