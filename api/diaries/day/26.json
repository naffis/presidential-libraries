Call was at 9 A.M. Washington time. I ordered plane set up at 12:30. Began getting things in order.\r\nCongress quitting tonight.\r\nUnification bill passed. Asked that it be sent up so I could appoint Defence [sic] Secretary. Printing office closed. Finally recieved [sic] bill at air port. Signed it and appointed Forestal [sic]. All favor him. Took off at 12:30 Washington time. At 1:30 Washington time recieved [sic] message my mother has passed on. Terrible shock. No one knew it.\r\nArrived in Grandview about 3:30 CST[,] went to the house and met sister & brother. Went to Belton with them and picked a casket. A terrible ordeal. Back to Grandview and then to Independence with Bess & Margie. They were at airport to meet me but stayed in Grandview while I went to Belton with Vivian & Mary.\r\nSpent Sunday morning and afternoon at Grandview. Mamma had been placed in casket we had decided upon and returned to her cottage. I couldn't look at her dead. I wanted to remember [her] alive when she was at her best.","URL":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page24.htm","Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5859990","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"Harry S.
