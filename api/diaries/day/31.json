Informed him that there were still Nazi war criminals loose in his country. They should be rounded up and deported for trial.\r\nHe talked of Communism in Chili [sic], Brazil and Bolivia. It was intimated that Argentines [sic] compliance was the subject of conversation. He said that Communism is rife in Brazil.\r\nI doubt if we accomplished anything.

George made me a proposition to extend the present law to Feb. 1950. I told him I would agree to an extention to Feb. 28, 1951 and would be most happy to have him and his Republican opposite member Senator Milikan [sic] of Colo. make the Reciprocal Trade Agreements a campaign issue in 1950. The great Georgia Senator, representative of the National Chamber of Commerce, the Coca Cola Company etc. didn't want that. So we'll start the filibuster when the Senate reconvenes.\r\nUsual appointments before and after and then -\r\nAt four o'clock Clinton Anderson, Senator from New Mexico, Elmer Thomas, Senator from Oklahoma, Scott Lucas, Illinois floor leader of the majority in the Senate, Charlie Brannan, the Secretary of Agriculture, Harold D. Cooley, Congressman from North Carolina, Chmn of the Com on Agriculture in the House as Thomas is in the Senate, and Stephen Pace from Georgia ranking member of the House Agricultural Com. in the House and the man who has made the best farm speech so far this session, came to the Cabinet room to discuss the Administration Stand on a farm\r\n\r\nLook at Aug 30.\r\nTuesday, August 30, 1949\r\n\r\nbill. The Sec of Agriculture, at my direction prepared a farm plan - a good one which I have supported. Stephen Pace produced a committee supported bill in the House which came up and was defeated by a substitute offered by Gore of Tennesee.\r\n\r\nMy former Secretary of Agriculture, Senator Anderson of New Mexico, who made a wrong guess in 1948 and thought the election of a Senator from N. Mex. surer than the election of the President in 1948, is as Senators always are very jealous of his Cabinet successor. Especially since the press (most often against us) has named the Administration Farm Bill the Brannan Bill. Old man Thomas is a most peculiar person. I've heard him talk for hours on silver. Lead & zinc are Okla. metals. But he's Chairman of the Senate Com. on Agriculture.\r\n\r\nI placed the two House members beside me on the President's side of the Cabinet table and put Brannan in the V.P.'s seat across the table with the high powered senators on each side of him. Then we put the \"cards on the table.\" I reminded them of the Dem. Platform of 1948 of my 31700 trip and my farm speeches and then the House members came in and did the same. The Senators made speeches and then went back and reported a bill. Will get our farm progress.","URL":null,"Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"7542743","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"George Bush","Year":"1991","Month":"1","Day":"31","Meeting Text":null,"URL":"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/186337","Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"186337","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null}]
