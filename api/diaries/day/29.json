The concert was a wow - \"hangin' from the rafters\" says Margie. She says the terrible Post Dispatch (which hates me) and the old dyed in the wool conservative Globe Democrat have been kind to her. Just read an old editorial from the Globe Democrat today which came from Roosevelt's files of 1940. They'd decided that Missouri had gone to hell because I'd beaten the double crosser Lloyd Stark for the nomination for the Senate! Stark had sent the piece to Roosevelt. It's hell how fate works. Stark wanted to be President - I didn't. Stark's buried politically because he is intellectually dishonest. I'm forced on the Democratic ticket as V.P. by the man who thought Stark was tops - and I'm the President and in my own right.\r\n\r\nIt's hell on Margie but she is a good trouper!","URL":null,"Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"7542747","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"Harry S.
