We had a very nice breakfast and signed autographs for the commandant and the troop commander. I wrote a personal note to our host and autographed dollar bills for all the help.\r\nWhen we arrived at the plane we found everybody present but the press secretary, Charlie Ross. He'd told Hassett to put on his stripped [sic] pants and formal coat and Mr. Hassett had done so. Then he had to go out in the rain and call a number of the party. Gen[eral] Vaughan said he'd put grapefruits in the knees of his pants! We sent a special messenger for Ross and he arrived in time for us to take off at 3:15.\r\nArrived at Belem at 8:45. Saw the Guiana jungle and was greatly impressed at the Amazon. It is beyond discription [sic]. We landed on its south bank. I took a walk around the air station. We were in the air at 9:15 A.M. Saw all of Brazil from Belem to Rio de Janeiro. Our approach to Rio was as perfect as we could have wanted.\r\nCircled the city, landed on an island in the harbour [sic]. Took a power boat to the city. The President & Mrs. Dutra recieved [sic] us and we had a drive and reception through the city that seldom happens.","URL":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page28.htm","Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5859997","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"Harry S.

Matt Connelly & Clark Clifford on one side and Charlie Ross & John Steelman on the other.\r\nMatt & Clark were afraid Luckman is trying to steal the lime light in the food emergency. I'm not. We worked out a statement for the 10 A.M. meeting in the movie room for the Citizens Committee.\r\nIt was a good meeting. I went back to the office and had the usual go around until 1 P.M. Then had to decide the argument between Charlie & John and Clark & Matt. I let Luckman announce his committee plan at a press conference, supporting Charlie & John.\r\nListened to some commentators and then called Dr. Steelman & told him to tell Luckman he'd done well. He'd had a hell of a press conference and some of the smart alecks had tried to trap him.\r\nHe came out very well.\r\nWe Are Going to Win This One.","URL":null,"Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5860004","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"Harry S.

Trying to make the 81st Congress perform is and has been worse than cussing the 80th. A President never loses prestige fighting Congress. And I can't fight my own Congress. There are some terrible Chairmen in the 81st. But so far things have come out fairly well. I've kissed and petted more consarned S.O.B. so-called Democrats and left wing Republicans than all the Presidents put together. I have very few people fighting my battles in Congress as I fought F.D.R.'s\r\n\r\nHad dinner by myself tonight. Worked in the Lee House office until dinner time. A butler came in very formally and said \"Mr President dinner is served.\" I walk into the dining room in the Blair House. Barnett in tails and white tie pulls out my chair, pushes me up to the table. John in tails and white tie brings me a fruit cup, Barnett takes away the empty cup. John bring me a plate, Barnett brings me a tenderloin, John brings me aspargus, Barrett brings me carrots and beets. I have to eat alone and in silence in candle lit room.\r\n\r\n-2- Monday, October 31, 1949\r\n\r\nfrom opposite page.\r\n\r\nI ring - Barnett takes the plate and butter plates. John comes in with a napkin and silver crumb tray - there are no crumbs but John has to brush them off the table anyway. Barrett bring me a plate with a finger bowl and doyle [sic] on it-I remove finger bowl and doyle [sic] and John puts a glass saucer and a little bowl on the plate. Barnett brings me some chocolate custard. John brings me a demitasse (at home a little cup of coffee - about two good gulps) and my dinner is over. I take a hand bath in the finger bowl and go back to work.\r\n\r\nWhat a life!","URL":null,"Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"7542748","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"Harry S.
