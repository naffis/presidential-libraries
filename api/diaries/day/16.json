Truman","Year":"1947","Month":"1","Day":"16","Meeting Text":"Had quite a day. (Look at schedule for this day, the day before and the day before that.) The Crown Prince of Arabia with his retinue and the Minister from his country to ours came in with the Secretary of State (Mr. Byrnes) and discussed Mid East Affairs at some length. Arabians are jealous of Syrians, Iraqis, Egyptians and Turks. They seem to like us but are suspicious of the British. They hate the Bolshiviks [sic]. It was an interesting talk.\r\nThey afterwards came to lunch. It was a gala affair. See guest list.\r\nWas sitting at my desk just before dinner tonight when [name of person and staff position restricted] came up and asked if he might speak to me. He was scared stiff and almost crying. Said he'd got his checks mixed up, had lied to the Secret Service and he wanted to tell me before his boss did. As usual I felt sorry for him and promised to help him out. I wonder why nearly everyone makes a father confessor out of me. I must look benevolent or else I'm a known easy mark. Well any way I like people and like to help 'em and keep 'em out of trouble when I can and help 'em out when they get into it.\r\nThe rule around here is that no one may speak to the President. I break it every day and make 'em speak to me. So-you see what I get. But I still want 'em to tell me.","URL":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page9.htm","Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5848069","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"George Bush","Year":"1990","Month":"1","Day":"16","Meeting Text":null,"URL":"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/186324","Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"186324","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"George Bush","Year":"1991","Month":"2","Day":"16","Meeting Text":null,"URL":"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/186353","Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"186353","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null}]
