Truman","Year":"1947","Month":"7","Day":"23","Meeting Text":"Had the usual hectic day, though not so bad as some I've had.\r\nLectured eleven junior Democratic Congressmen on foreign policy. Had four Republicans not long ago-nice young men, to whom I gave the same treatment. If I could only get all the young ones together, the military & foreign policy would become the law of the land.\r\nTalked to young Franklin for almost thirty minutes on Jews, New York, California, his daddy's papers and political matters generally. Said he & his mamma were not with Henry Wallace!\r\nWent to Jim Forestal's [sic] house to a party for Bob Patterson. It was a nice one. A couple of Senators-Vandenburg [sic] & Gurney, the Cabinet, Gen[eral] Eisenhower & three Navy Captains. Don't know [why] Leahy, Nimitz & House members were not there. Sam Rayburn was present-only House member there.\r\nHow we'll miss Mrs. Patterson! as well as the Sec[retary] of War. Looks as if we've lost a grand, honest man & wife of the same caliber and have gained a good man and a baby talking, henna haired lady. She went to school with Claire Booth Luce-too bad I'd say. Cabinet women are a problem. I'll write a book on it some day.\r\n\r\n","URL":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page22.htm","Index":"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/index.html","NARA Catalog":"5859987","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"George Bush","Year":"1991","Month":"1","Day":"23","Meeting Text":null,"URL":"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/186329","Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"186329","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null},{"President":"George Bush","Year":"1991","Month":"2","Day":"23","Meeting Text":null,"URL":"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/186359","Index":null,"NARA Catalog":"186359","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":null,"Machine Readable Text":null,"Number of Pages":null}]
