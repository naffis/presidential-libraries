Marshall is the ablest man in the whole gallery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roosevelt came in at 3 P.M. to assure me that Jimmy & Elliott had nothing against me and intended no disparagement of me in their recent non-edited remarks. Said she was for me. Said she didn't like Byrnes and was sure he was not reporting Elliott correctly. Said Byrnes was always for Byrnes and no one else. I wonder! He's been loyal to me[.] In the Senate he gave me my first small appropriation, which started the Special Committee to investigate the National Defense Program on its way. He'd probably have done me a favor if he'd refused to give it.\r\n\r\nMaybe there was something on both sides in this situation. It is a pity a great man has to have progeny! Look at Churchill's. Remember Lincoln's and Grant's. Even in collateral branches Washington's wasn't so good-and Teddy Roosevelt's are terrible.","URL":"http://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/page3.htm","Index":"http://www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/","NARA Catalog":"5842783","Locations":null,"People":null,"Notes":null,"Diary Type":null,"Image File Format":"JPG","Machine Readable Text":"Y","Number of Pages":null},{"President":"Harry S.
